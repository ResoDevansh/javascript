# Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental part of programming. An array is a list of data. We can store a lot of data in one variable, which makes our code more readable and easier to understand. It also makes it much easier to perform functions on related data.
 
The data in arrays are called **elements**.
Each data has a unique **index** value.
Neither the **data** type in javascript arrays is fixed nor the **length** of array.
Here is a simple array:

```javascript
// 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 are the elements in this array
var numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8];
```
Index values corresponding to each element= [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
